# StadiaToSCP

This program maps the raw input from the Stadia controller to a virtual Xbox controller driver included in the unofficial DualShock 3/4 driver "ScpToolkit". This allows the analog triggers and rumble to work in any game that supports XInput.

## Running:

* Download and install the [ScpToolkit virtual XInput driver](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/releases/tag/v1.7.277.16103-BETA) (no need to worry about pairing a controller in the setup process)
* Clone this repository and build with Micrsoft Visual Studio
